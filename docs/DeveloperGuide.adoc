== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites
Listed below are the prerequites:

** *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

** *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
Listed below are the steps to set up the project:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ. (If you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first.)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors.
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully.
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error.
. Repeat this for the test folder as well. (E.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way.)

=== Verifying the setup
Listed below are the steps to verify the setup:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify, follow these steps:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: Change the import order to `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.
[NOTE]
Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms. (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based.)

==== Getting started with coding

Listed below are some things to try when you are ready to start coding:

** Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
** Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the high-level design of the App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events. (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command (Part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command (Part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
Given below is the structure of the UI component.

.Structure of the `UI` Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As shown in the figure above, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
Shown below is the structure of the `Logic` component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

As shown in the figure above, `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
Shown below is the structure of the `Model` component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

As shown by the figure above, the `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
Shown below is the structure of the `Storage` component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

As shown by the figure above, the `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternate implementations of undo & redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Use individual commands to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: Must ensure that the implementations of individual commands are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::schedulecommand[]
=== Schedule command feature
==== Current implementation
The scheduling appointment mechanism is facilitated by `ScheduleCommandParser`, `ScheduleCommand`, `Appointment` and `AppointmentManager`.
`ScheduleCommand` extends from `Command` and `ScheduleCommandParser` implements `Parser`.
The key operation implemented is `ScheduleCommand#execute`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the schedule command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user wants to schedule an appointment. User proceeds to fill in the details behind the respective prefixes.

For example: `schedule 1 d/23.11.2018 st/1300 et/1400 dn/Jack di/S1234567B pn/John Doe pi/S1234567A`

Step 2. The user executes the `ScheduleCommand` which calls the `ScheduleCommandParser`.
`ScheduleCommandParser` will parse the inputs and return a `ScheduleCommand`.

Step 3. `ScheduleCommand` then executes.
`ScheduleCommand` then conducts various checks sequentially to ensure that the appointment scheduled is valid.
If it is invalid, an exception message will be thrown.
The `Appointment` will not be scheduled.
The order of checks conducted are displayed in the image below.

image::AppointmentCheckingFlow.png[width="800"]

Step 4. A successful check gives 2 objects, `personToEdit` and `Appointment` object.
Program creates another `Person` object called `editedPerson` that is equal to `personToEdit`.
`ScheduleCommand` then adds `Appointment` to the `appointmentList` of `editedPerson`.
Lastly, `ScheduleCommand` replaces `personToEdit` with `editedPerson` in our model.
This is shown in the diagram below.

image::ScheduleCommandStep4.png[width="800"]

The above procedure in step 4 is then repeated for the other person (e.g. other person is a doctor if specified person is a patient) affected in the scheduling process.

Step 5. `XmlAdaptedPerson` updates storage of `appointmentList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the schedule appointment operation works:

.Sequence diagram for scheduling appointments
image::ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternate implementations of schedule.

===== Aspect: Command for schedule command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Take in the inputs for schedule appointment command using one prefix for each detail.
For example: `schedule 1 d/23.11.2018 st/1300 et/1400 dn/Jack di/S1234567B pn/John Doe pi/S1234567A`
** Pros: The design is consistent with the other commands in the application.
** Cons: It requires the user to type more when scheduling an appointment.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a comma-separated long string in the command prompt to schedule an appointment.
For example: `schedule 1 s/23.11.2018,1300,1400,Jack,S1234567B,John Doe,S1234567A`
** Pros: The user has to type less when scheduling a command.
The user is not required to type all the prefixes, he just has to type one prefix, `s/`.
** Cons: The design would not be consistent with the other commands.
This might confuse the user.

===== Aspect: Sorting of appointments
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do not sort the appointments in the ArrayList of appointments.
A new appointment is added to the back of the ArrayList.
** Pros: It is simple to check for appointment clashes.
To check for appointment clashes, just loop through the ArrayList and check the new appointment against every other appointment.
The simplicity is shown in code below.
[source,java]
public static boolean isClash(Appointment appointment, Appointment otherAppointment) {
    if (appointment.isClash(otherAppointment)) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
** Cons: It might not be the most efficient way.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort the appointments in the ArrayList of appointments.
Maintain a sorted list of appointments based on the date and time of appointments.
** Pros: It might be more efficient when checking for appointment clashes.
We do not need to check our new appointment against all the appointments in the ArrayList.
For example we can check from the last (latest) appointment down the list until a point where the next appointment ends before this appointment.
At that point we can stop checking as we know that there will be no more clashes.
** Cons: The efficiency gain when checking for clashes might be lost due to efficiency lost due to sorting being required.
// end::schedulecommand[]

// tag::intuitivecommandprompt[]
=== Intuitive command prompt
==== Current implementation
The Intuitive Command Prompt feature is facilitated mainly by two classes: `IntuitivePromptManager`
and `IntuitiveEntryCommand`.

`IntuitiveEntryCommand` extends `Command`, and represents the logic to be
executed when the user enters an input during the execution of an intuitive command. The `IntuitiveEntryCommand`
communicates with the `Model` interface in order to add an input into, or remove an input from the
`IntuitivePromptManager`.

The `IntuitivePromptManager` exists to store the inputs entered by the user during the execution of an
intuitive command, and once all prompts or fields of the intuitive command have been filled, uses the stored inputs
to prepare a String that represents a non-intuitive command (e.g. `add n/NAME p/PHONE ...`) back to the
AddressBookParser in order to execute this command.

The `IntuitivePromptManager` also has an `ArgumentManager`
that determines how to keep track of the arguments for its respective intuitive command.

`IntuitivePromptManager` has six public-access methods that allow the `Model` to communicate with it.
They are the following:

****
* `IntuitivePromptManager#addArgument(input)`: takes in a string input and stores it as an argument
* `IntuitivePromptManager#removeArgument()`: removes the latest stored argument(s)
* `IntuitivePromptManager#getInstruction()`: retrieves the instruction or prompt to be shown to the user
(for the field that One Life is currently prompting the user for)
* `IntuitivePromptManager#retrieveArguments()`: prepares and returns the String that represents the non-intuitive
command, called when all fields have been filled
* `IntuitivePromptManager#isIntuitiveMode()`: checks if One Life is currently executing an intuitive command
* `IntuitivePromptManager#areArgsAvailable()`: checks if there are any arguments still being stored in the
`IntuitivePromptManager`
****

With the above operations in mind, below is an example usage scenario of how an intuitive command works at each step.
We will be using the example of an intuitive `add` command.

===== Start of Intuitive Command
The intuitive command first needs to be triggered:

Step 1. User wishes to add a new patient. User types `add` into the command prompt and submits.

Step 2. `AddressBookParser` parses the input and detects the `add` command word without any trailing arguments.
Intuitive mode is triggered and a new `IntuitiveEntryCommand` is created.

Step 3. `LogicManager` executes the `IntuitiveEntryCommand`.
`IntuitiveEntryCommand` interfaces with `Model` to add and store the user's input
in the `IntuitivePromptManager`.

Step 4. `Model` calls the `IntuitivePromptManager` to store the user's input as an argument. Since the user's
input is the `add` command word, the `IntuitivePromptManager` triggers it's intuitive mode - it creates the respective
`ArgumentManager` (in this case it is an `AddArgumentManager`) and stores it in a variable called `argumentManager`.

Step 5. `Model` then calls the `IntuitivePromptManager` to retrieve the next prompt to be shown to the user.
`IntuitivePromptManager` asks `argumentManager` to retrieve the correct instruction.
This String instruction representing the prompt to be shown is then returned by `IntuitivePromptManager` and `Model` then
proceeds to return this String instruction to the executing `IntuitiveEntryCommand`.

Step 6. `IntuitiveEntryCommand` uses the String instruction to create a new `CommandResult`, which is then returned
to the `LogicManager` to be displayed to the user.

The following two sequence diagrams (Figures 11 & 12) describes the above process:

.High level sequence diagram detailing interactions between `Logic` and `Model`
image::IntuitiveCommandWordSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Internal sequence diagram showing how `IntuitivePromptManager` interacts with `argumentManager`
image::ArgumentManagerStartSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Middle of Intuitive Command

As the intuitive command has now started and is in the midst of execution, the system prompts the
user for an input for the next field:

Step 1. The system displays the instruction which prompts the user for the role of the person to be added.
The user enters `patient` to indicate that the person added is a patient.

Step 2-3. These steps are similar to Steps 2-3 of the above section (Start of Intuitive Command), with the exception that the input is now `patient`

Step 4. `Model` calls the `IntuitivePromptManager` to store the user's input as an argument. Since the intuitive
command is already executing, the user's input is stored as an argument in the `arguments` list.
The `currentArgIndex`, which allows the `IntuitivePromptManager` to determine the what field it should prompt for next
is incremented accordingly by the `ArgumentManager`:

.How the `arguments` list in `IntuitivePromptManager` records arguments with `currentArgIndex`
image::IntuitiveInternalDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 5-6. These steps are the same as that of the above section (Start of Intuitive Command)

===== End of Intuitive Command
Once all fields have been filled by the user, the system will exit intuitive mode as follows:

Step 1-3. These steps are the same as those of the above section (Start of Intuitive Command). Take note that this is the last field that the user has to fill.

Step 4. `Model` calls the `IntuitivePromptManager` to store the user's input as an argument. The input is
stored as an argument in the `arguments` list. The `IntuitivePromptManager` detects that this is the last
field required to be filled and calls `IntuitivePromptManager#exitIntuitiveMode()` to signal the end of
the intuitive command.

Step 5. `Model` retrieves the next prompt from the `IntuitivePromptManager` but since there are no more
fields needing to be filled, `IntuitivePromptManager` returns a loading message to be displayed to the user,
to inform the user that the intuitive command is complete and the arguments provided by the user are being processed

Step 6. `LogicManager` detects that the intuitive command has exited and that there are arguments stored in the
`IntuitivePromptManager`. Using the `Model` interface, it requests to retrieve the arguments in the
`IntuitivePromptManager` as a String line (representing a non-intuitive command).

Step 7. This String line is passed into the `AddressBookParser` to be parsed. The sequence flow from here is
the same as if the user entered the non-intuitive version of the command.

The following sequence diagram describes Step 6 and onwards.

.High level sequence diagram showing how arguments are retrieved at the end of the intuitive command
image::IntuitiveEndSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Going Back
The user has the ability to undo the inputs that he enters into each field. This is known as going back,
and is achieved when the user types `/bk`. The following usage scenario describes how this takes place:

Step 1. The user decides to undo his input for the previous field, and types `/bk`.

Step 2. The system behaves as per normal as mentioned above, treating `/bk` as a normal input.

Step 3. When `IntuitiveEntryCommand#execute()` is called, it detects that the input is the go back command
`/bk`. It calls `Model#removeIntuitiveEntry()` to remove the input filled into the latest field.

Step 4. `Model#removeIntuitiveEntry()` calls `IntuitivePromptManager#removeArgument()`, and the
`IntuitivePromptManager` removes the input filled into the latest field. `currentArgIndex` is decremented
as accordingly by the `ArgumentManager` as shown in the code snippet below:

```
public void removeArgument() {
    if (currentArgIndex <= ArgumentManager.MIN_ARGUMENT_INDEX) {
        return;
    }

    currentArgIndex = argumentManager.removeArgumentForCommand(arguments, currentArgIndex);
}
```


Step 5. `Model` retrieves the instruction of the field indicated by the `currentArgIndex` of the
`IntuitivePromptManager`. Execution continues normally as described in the above sections.

The following two sequence diagrams (Figures 15 & 16) describe the above process:

.Internal sequence digram showing going back ability
image::ArgumentManagerBackSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Commands & Argument Managers
The following `XYZArgumentManagers` inherit from `ArgumentManager`. They handle arguments for and represent the different commands as stated below:

* `AddArgumentManager`: Represents the intuitive `add` command
* `DeleteArgumentManager`: Represents the intuitive `delete` command
* `FindArgumentManager`: Represents the intuitive `find` command

=== Display doctor's current availability feature
==== Current implementation

The display of each doctor's current availability is facilitated by `PersonProfilePage`, `Doctor`, `AppointmentManager`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the information is generated and propagated to be displayed in the
`PersonProfilePage` at the final stage.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `MainWindow` will be initialized.

Step 2. The user then selects one of the doctors to view his/her profile via the `PersonProfilePage`.

Step 3. This then loads the `PersonProfilePage` that displays all of the person's particulars, be it a doctor or
patient. In the event that this `PersonProfilePage` belongs to a doctor, it calls the method
`Doctor#currentAvailStatus` to retrieve information on the doctor's current availability.

Step 4. Next, upon calling the method `Doctor#currentAvailStatus`, a helper method in `AppointmentManager`, called
`AppointmentManager#isAnyAppointmentOngoing` executes.

Step 5. `AppointmentManager` retrieves the current locale date and time from our `Date` and `Time` class and compare the
current time with all the scheduled appointments that the doctor has, and determines if the doctor is currently
available.

Step 6. The status information generated in `AppointmentManager` is propagated back up to the
`PersonProfilePage` which then sets a badge (available/busy) to reflect the availability status of that doctor.

Step 7. As long as the user remains on the same `PersonProfilePage`, this method continues to run in the background,
providing real time update of the doctor's availability at that point in time.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user launches the application:

image::DisplayDoctorAvailabilitySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternate implementations of the doctor's availability feature.

===== Aspect: How to display each doctor's availability

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A badge in each doctor's `PersonProfilePage` display that shows his/her current
availability.
** Pros: Convenient for the user to refer to since the badge is always on the display.
** Cons: Limited to only checking and viewing the availability status of one doctor at a time, thus will not be able
 to get a consolidated list/view of all doctors who are available or busy at the moment.
* **Alternative 2:** A separate command that the user can call upon to look up the current availability of all doctors.
** Pros: Able to call this method repeatedly/when needed and will be provided with the latest information.
** Cons: Need to have a separate command dedicated to this feature which may not be necessary and not as convenient as
compared to having a badge that is on the display at all times. Also this adds on to the list of commands that the
user has to get familiar with.

===== Aspect: How to update the status of each doctor's availability

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A function that will refresh the badge every few seconds.
** Pros: Provides accurate information and real time update on the doctor's availability.
** Cons: Affects the performance of the application due to this function continuously running in the background.
* **Alternative 2:** Updates the status/badge only on launch of application and only when there is a
change in information stored in the database.
** Pros: Implementation is easy.
** Cons: Information is outdated as it does not truly reflect the doctor's current availability.
// end::displaydoctoravailability[]

// tag::updatecommand[]
=== Update command feature
==== Current implementation
The updating medical record mechanism is facilitated by `UpdateCommandParser`, `UpdateCommand` and `MedicalRecord`.
`UpdateCommand` extends from `Command` and `UpdateCommandParser` extends from `Parser`.
The key operation implemented is `UpdateCommand#execute`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user wants to update the medical record library of a `Patient`. User proceeds to fill in the details behind the respective prefixes.

For example: `update 1 d/16.10.2018 dg/flu tr/tamiflu c/to be taken thrice a day`

Step 2. The user executes the command which calls the `UpdateCommandParser`.
`UpdateCommandParser` will first parse the inputs and create a `MedicalRecord` with the given date, diagnosis, treatment and comment, and return an `UpdateCommand` with the new `MedicalRecord`.

[NOTE]
If no comment is given the default comment "-" is used.

Step 3. `UpdateCommand` will then be executed.
`UpdateCommand` will first do the following checks on the user input to ensure that the command input was valid:

Checks:

** Whether the index of input person is valid.
** Whether the person specified by the index is a patient.
** Whether the specified date is a valid date.
** Whether the specified date is before the current date.
** Whether the input contain invalid prefixes.

If it was invalid, an exception message will be thrown and the `MedicalRecord` will not be added into the patient's medical record library.

Step 4. If the checks are successful, all the attributes of the specified person will first be copied, including the existing medical record library of the specified `Patient`.

Step 5. The new `MedicalRecord` will be added into the copied medical record library which is an `ArrayList` of `MedicalRecord`. The new `MedicalRecord` is added to the front of the list and since the pointer for the latest medical record is always pointing to the first element, the latest medical record will be automatically updated.

image::UpdateSequenceDiagramStep5.png[width="800"]

Step 6. A new `Patient` is created with all the copied attributes and the updated medical record library.

Step 7. The existing `Patient` that was specified is updated to the newly created `Patient` in the model.

The following sequence diagram shows how the update medical record operation works:

.Sequence diagram for an update command
image::UpdateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternate implementations of updating medical records.

===== Aspect: How to store a patient's medical record library

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an ArrayList of `MedicalRecord` as the patient's medical record library.
** Pros: Accessing the most recent record by retrieving the first `MedicalRecord` in the ArrayList is easy. Given below is a code snippet that demonstrates how this is done.
[source,java]
if (medicalRecordLibrary.size() != 0) {
    return medicalRecordLibrary.get(medicalRecordLibrary.size() - 1);
} else {
    return null;
}

** Cons: Retrieving the latest `MedicalRecord` before a specified date takes longer as each `MedicalRecord` has to be checked sequentially until the last `MedicalRecord` before the specified date is found.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a different data structure like a TreeMap of `MedicalRecord` as the value and date for the key as the patient's medical record library.
** Pros: Retrieving the latest `MedicalRecord` before a specified date is made convenient by  just using the floor function already defined in the TreeMap API.
** Cons: Maintaining the TreeSet for more complicated tasks like editing `MedicalRecord` may be difficult since a new `MedicalRecord` has to be created and reinserted into the same location in the TreeSet.
// end::updatecommand[]

// tag::findcommand[]
=== Find command feature
==== Current implementation
The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand`, `FindCommandParser` and `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate`.
`FindCommand` extends from `Command`, `FindCommandParser` implements `Parser` and `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate`
implements `Predicate`.
The key operation implemented is `FindCommand#execute`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user wants to find all `Person` who have a `friends` `Tag`, with `Name` either `Alex` or `Bernice` by
executing `find n/Alex n/Bernice t/friends`.

Step 2. `FindCommandParser` will parse the input and verify that is it valid before creating a
`PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`, which is passed into `FindCommand`. Then, `FindCommand` is returned.

* `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate` takes in a `HashMap` of `Prefix` mapped to an `ArrayList` of search parameters. The
code snippet below illustrates how a `FindCommand` is created:

[source, java]
public FindCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        ...
        // Performs checks to see if the arguments entered are valid.
        ...
        // Process arguments into a HashMap personSearchKeywords which is used to create a PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate to be passed into FindCommand.
        ...
        return new FindCommand(new PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate(personSearchKeywords));
    }

* `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate` tests if a `Person` should appear when searched by iterating through each of the keys
in the `HashMap` and returning `true` if all of the `Person` 's attributes match at least 1 of the entries in each key's
`ArrayList`. The image below illustrates the list of `Person` that return `true` for
`PersonContainsKeywordPredicate#test`
after the user input `find n/Alex n/Bernice t/friends`.

.PersonContainsKeywordPredicate test result
image::FindCommandDeveloperGuidePredicate.png[width="600"]

* As can be seen in the image above, `Person` at index 0 and index 2 have at least 1 entry in `Name` and `Tag` that
match the required search parameters. Therefore, they will be shown in the result list. Even though `Person` at index 1
has a match in the `Name` attribute, he does not have a `friends` `Tag` and is therefore not shown.

[NOTE]
If there is no input after the "find" keyword, `IntuitiveEntryCommand` will be triggered, which will prompt the user to
input search parameters.

Step 3. `FindCommand` will then be executed.

Step 4. `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` will be called, which uses `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate` to  update
`Model` to show all `Person` that contains the searched parameters.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user launches the application:

.Find command sequence diagram
image::FindCommandDeveloperGuideSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to input search fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow users to perform searches by specifying certain keywords of interest.
(For example: `Name` : `n/`, `Phone`: `p/`)
** Pros: It results in a powerful and precise search function by providing the user the option to specify exactly which
`Person` attributes are of interest.
** Cons: It may be difficult for newer users to remember the shortcuts that represent the attributes of interest.
* **Alternative 2:** Generalise the search function by searching through all fields and providing the most relevant
information through predictive search.
** Pros: It provides an even more powerful search function that is both simple to use and accurate.
** Cons: It is incredibly difficult to implement such an search function without the use of machine-learning algorithms
or an internet connection.

===== Aspect: How to implement the search (And versus Or)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement *And Search* between different attributes but *Or Search* for keywords
within the same attribute.
** Pros: It allows users the option of either making their search more general by including different options for the
same attribute (i.e. allow multiple names to be searched at once) and also more precise by adding more attributes to be
searched (i.e. allow users to search for `friends` named `Alex` versus only people named `Alex`).
** Cons: It may be confusing for newer users as the search function is not consistently And or Or. Users are also unable
to carry out a search that will show all persons with two differing attributes (i.e. a search that shows only persons
named `Alex` who are tagged as `friends`, as well as persons named `Bernice` who are tagged as `family` is impossible
with the current search structure. `Alex` tagged as `family` and `Bernice` tagged as `friends` will also appear).
* **Alternative 2:** Implement the current search but allow multiple search entries to be evaluated at the same time
so that it is possible to show results of different searches compiled on the same list.
** Pros: It provides all the benefits of the current search function while extending its capabilities to allow unrelated
people to be searched together in one go.
** Cons: It may become even more confusing to newer users to use the search function. It is also difficult to implement
such a search function without having multiple lines for input entry. As of now, the application only supports a single
line of user input at a time.

// end::findcommand[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

Shown below is a list of site-wide attributes and a short description for each attribute.
[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file documentation settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

Shown below is a list of per-file attributes and a short description for each.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes

|===

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests`. (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests`. (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo. (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually. (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `appointment` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `appointment` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `appointment` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'appointment' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `appointment` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for appointment in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a appointment for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the appointment label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the appointment in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a appointment).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<appointment>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our appointment label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `appointment` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's appointment.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning appointment label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `appointment` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
