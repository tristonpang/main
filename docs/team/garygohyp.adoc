== PROJECT: One Life

---

=== Introduction

This project portfolio details my key contributions to the project One Life and serves to document the key features I implemented.

One Life is a desktop application designed by me and other students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) as part of a requirement for our software engineering module under the given constraints that the user must interact with it using a Command Line Interface(CLI).

One life is used for storing, updating, and displaying data related to patients and doctors. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

=== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to update and display medical records.*
** _What it does:_
*** Enables the user to update the current medical record history of a specified patient on a specified date.
*** Checks if the given information such as the date, diagnosis or treatment are valid.
** _Justification:_
*** Streamlines a key part of medical operations in a hospital. (Updating and referring to the current medical history of any given patient.)
** _Highlights:_
*** Improves how data is stored, retrieved, and sorted.
*** Requires in-depth analysis of design alternatives when choosing the most efficient method of storing medical record data.
*** Requires a brand new command to be created and existing code to be edited.
* *Minor enhancement*: added a check to verify if a given date is valid and in the correct format.
