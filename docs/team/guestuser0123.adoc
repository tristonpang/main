== PROJECT: One Life

---

== Overview

One Life is a desktop hospital management application used for efficient storing and retrieving of data related to
the doctors and patients (e.g. personal particulars, medical records, appointments, etc). It makes use of a Command
Line Interface (CLI), and it uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created via JavaFX. The program is written in Java,
and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to display each doctor's profile and their current availability status.*
** What it does: This allows the user to view the details of each doctor (e.g. phone number, medical specialization,
etc), as well as the current availability status of each doctor.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily retrieve the data of each
doctor, and more importantly the current availability status of each doctor. Since this is a hospital management
application that will be used by nurses or medical administrative staff, in cases of a medical emergency or when a
doctor is required, the user can easily know which doctors are available at the moment to help/address the medical
situation.
** Highlights: This enhancement improves this application's ability to serve as a hospital management application as
it provides real time update of the availability status of each doctor. The implementation too was challenging as
 it required addition of new event handlers to facilitate propagation of information stored in the backend, to the
 frontend i.e. GUI where the information is processed and displayed to the user.

* *Minor enhancement*: changed the existing `add` and `list` commands such that it facilitates adding and viewing of
doctors and patients separately (refer to _4.Contributions to the User Guide_ for more information).
