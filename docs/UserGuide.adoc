== Introduction

One Life (OL) is designed for service providers in the healthcare industry who *prefer to use a desktop application for
managing patient and doctor information*. More importantly, One Life is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you prefer typing, One Life can get your medical information management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
Listed below are instructions to help you get started:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for One Life.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI (as shown in Figure 1 below) should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
E.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts.
* **`add`**`r/patient n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 ic/S9601234A` : adds a `Patient` named `John Doe` to the database.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

// end::list[]

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the database. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

// tag::find[]
=== Locating person by any attribute: `find`

There are two types of Find Commands: Global Find and Specific Find, which can be used in conjunction with one
another. +
Format: `find [PREFIX] KEYWORDS [NEXT_PREFIX] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[NOTE]
In order for a `Person` to show up on `find`, the `Person` must match all attributes in the input. +
(i.e. `find n/alex r/doctor` will show all `Doctor` named `Alex`. If another `Alex` is not a `Doctor`, he will not be
shown.)

==== Global Find
Global Find is a search on all attributes of all `Person` in the database. +

It is performed when:

* no `Prefix` is included in the input, or when
* keywords are included before the first valid `Prefix`.

[NOTE]
When performing Global Find with more than one separate keyword, users can simply separate them using a `[SPACE]`.
The Find Command will interpret the input as separate words to be searched globally.

Examples:

* `find kang` +
Displays all `Person` with `kang` in any of their attributes.
* `find kang r/doctor` +
Displays all `Person` with `kang` in any of their attributes and whom is a `Doctor`. This is an example of Global Find
used in conjunction with Specific Find.
* `find alex doctor` +
Displays all `Person` with `alex` or `doctor` in any of their attributes.

The images below illustrate the utilisation of Global Find:

.Global find command

.Global find command with specific find command
image::FindCommandUserGuideGlobal2.png[width="400"]

.Global Find command with multiple keywords
image::FindCommandUserGuideGlobal3.png[width="400"]

==== Specific Find
Specific Find is a search on attributes specified by the user. (i.e. `Name`, `Phone` etc).

It is performed when a `Prefix` is specified in the input field. +
Below is a list of all searchable attributes and their corresponding `Prefix`:

.Table of searchable prefixes
[width="20"]
|===
| *Attribute*        | *Prefix*
| Name               | `n/`
| NRIC               | `ic/`
| Phone              | `p/`
| Email              | `e/`
| Address            | `a/`
| Role               | `r/`
| Tag                | `t/`
| Medical Department | `md/`
| Medical Record     | `mr/`
|===

[WARNING]
Search keywords must be entered behind a `Prefix` whenever a `Prefix` is used in the input. A command like
`find n/[BLANK]` is not a valid input. +
The `Prefix` entered must also be valid.

Examples:

* `find t/friends` +
Displays all `Person` with the `Tag` labelled `friends`.
* `find t/friends r/doctor` +
Displays all `Person` with the `Tag` labelled `friends` and whose `Role` is `Doctor`.
* The images below illustrate the utilisation of Specific Find.

.Specific find command

.Specific find command with additional prefixes
image::FindCommandUserGuideSpecific2.png[width="400"]

.Examples of invalid input for specific find command
image::FindCommandUserGuideError.png[width="400"]

****
* Find is case-insensitive. e.g. `nelvin` will match `Nelvin`.
* In Global Find, `Person` containing any of the given keywords in any of his/her attributes will be displayed.
e.g. `find doctor nelvin` will cause all `Doctor` and `Nelvin Tan` to be displayed.
* In Specific Find, the specified attribute of the `Person` must contain the searched keyword to be displayed.
e.g. `find n/Gary Goh` will display `Gary Goh` but not `Kenneth Goh`
* In the event that the user wants to specify more than one keyword to be seperately searched in a specified attribute,
for example if the user wants to find all `Person` with `Name` `Kang Tze` or `Triston`, he must separate the names
using two `Name` `Prefix`. e.g. `find n/Kang Tze n/Triston` displays `Ng Kang Tze` and `Triston Pang`.
* An illustration of a more complicated `find` command is `find friends n/Kang Tze n/Triston r/doctor`, which displays
all `Person` with `friends` in their attributes, has `name` containing either `Kang Tze` or `Triston`, and whom is a
`Doctor`.
