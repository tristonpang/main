== Introduction

OneLife (OL) is designed for service providers in the healthcare industry who *prefer to use a desktop application for
managing patient and doctor information*. More importantly, OneLife is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you prefer typing, OneLife can get your medical information management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
Listed below are instructions to help you get started:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for OneLife.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI (as shown in Figure 1 below) should appear in a few seconds.
+

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

// end::list[]

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the database. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

// tag::find[]
=== Locating person by any attribute: `find`

There are two types of Find Commands: Global Find and Specific Find, which can be used in conjunction with one
another. +
Format: `find [PREFIX] KEYWORDS [NEXT_PREFIX] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[NOTE]
In order for a `Person` to show up on `find`, the `Person` must match all attributes in the input. +
(i.e. `find n/alex r/doctor` will show all `Doctor` named `Alex`. If another `Alex` is not a `Doctor`, he will not be
shown.)

==== Global Find
Global Find is a search on all attributes of all `Person` in the database. +

It is performed when:

* no `Prefix` is included in the input, or when
* keywords are included before the first valid `Prefix`.

[NOTE]
When performing Global Find with more than one separate keyword, users can simply separate them using a `[SPACE]`.
The Find Command will interpret the input as separate words to be searched globally.

Examples:

* `find kang` +
Displays all `Person` with `kang` in any of their attributes.
* `find kang r/doctor` +
Displays all `Person` with `kang` in any of their attributes and whom is a `Doctor`. This is an example of Global Find
used in conjunction with Specific Find.
* `find alex doctor` +
Displays all `Person` with `alex` or `doctor` in any of their attributes.

The images below illustrate the utilisation of Global Find:

.Global Find Command
image::FindCommandUserGuideGlobal1.png[width="600"]

.Global Find Command with Specific Find Command
image::FindCommandUserGuideGlobal2.png[width="600"]

.Global Find Command with Multiple Keywords
image::FindCommandUserGuideGlobal3.png[width="600"]

==== Specific Find
Specific Find is a search on attributes specified by the user. (i.e. `Name`, `Phone` etc).

It is performed when a `Prefix` is specified in the input field. +
Below is a list of all searchable attributes and their corresponding `Prefix`:

|===
| *Attribute*        | *Prefix*
| Name               | `n/`
| NRIC               | `ic/`
| Phone              | `p/`
| Email              | `e/`
| Address            | `a/`
| Role               | `r/`
| Tag                | `t/`
| Medical Department | `md/`
| Medical Record     | `mr/`
|===

[WARNING]
Search keywords must be entered behind a `Prefix` whenever a `Prefix` is used in the input. A command like
`find n/[BLANK]` is not a valid input. +
The `Prefix` entered must also be valid.

Examples:

* `find t/friends` +
Displays all `Person` with the `Tag` labelled `friends`.
* `find t/friends r/doctor` +
Displays all `Person` with the `Tag` labelled `friends` and whose `Role` is `Doctor`.
* The images below illustrate the utilisation of Specific Find.

.Specific Find Command with Additional Prefixes
image::FindCommandUserGuideSpecific2.png[width="600"]

.Examples of Invalid Input for Specific Find Command
image::FindCommandUserGuideError.png[width="600"]

****
* Find is case-insensitive. e.g. `nelvin` will match `Nelvin`.
* In Global Find, `Person` containing any of the given keywords in any of his/her attributes will be displayed.
e.g. `find doctor nelvin` will cause all `Doctor` and `Nelvin Tan` to be displayed.
* In Specific Find, the specified attribute of the `Person` must contain the searched keyword to be displayed.
e.g. `find n/Gary Goh` will display `Gary Goh` but not `Kenneth Goh`
* In the event that the user wants to specify more than one keyword to be seperately searched in a specified attribute,
for example if the user wants to find all `Person` with `Name` `Kang Tze` or `Triston`, he must separate the names
using two `Name` `Prefix`. e.g. `find n/Kang Tze n/Triston` displays `Ng Kang Tze` and `Triston Pang`.
* An illustration of a more complicated `find` command is `find friends n/Kang Tze n/Triston r/doctor`, which displays
all `Person` with `friends` in their attributes, has `name` containing either `Kang Tze` or `Triston`, and whom is a
`Doctor`.
****

==== Intuitive Command Prompt (ICP) Support

ICP mode provides a more natural way of entering commands into OneLife. More information can be found under 3.18:
Intuitive command prompting.

The Find Command is supported by ICP in the following way:

* When the command word `find` is given without any other input, ICP mode is triggered.

After entering ICP Mode, the user will be prompted to select the attributes to be searched by entering the indexes
corresponding to the attributes. +
Below is a list of all searchable attributes and their corresponding indexes.

|===
| *Attribute*                         | *Index*
| Global                              | `1`
| Name                                | `2`
| NRIC                                | `3`
| Phone                               | `4`
| Email                               | `5`
| Address                             | `6`
| Role                                | `7`
| Tag                                 | `8`
| Medical Department                  | `9`
| Medical Record                      | `10`
|===

Lastly, the user will enter the corresponding keywords to be searched under each attribute, in increasing order of
their indexes.

The images below illustrate the utilisation of Find Command to execute the command `find doctor n/bernice` under ICP
mode: (Under Normal Mode, this command means `find` all `Person` with `doctor` in their attributes and whose name
contains `bernice`.)

.ICP Mode for Find Command Step 1
image::FindCommandUserGuideIcp1.png[width="600"]

.ICP Mode for Find Command Step 2
image::FindCommandUserGuideIcp2.png[width="600"]

.ICP Mode for Find Command Step 3
image::FindCommandUserGuideIcp3.png[width="600"]

.ICP Mode for Find Command Step 4
image::FindCommandUserGuideIcp4.png[width="600"]

[NOTE]
Under ICP Mode, for Specific Find, keywords separated by a comma are considered to be under multiple identical `Prefix`.
For example, entering `find n/alex n/bernice` under Normal Mode is identical to entering `alex, bernice` when prompted
for `Name` keywords under ICP Mode.

// end::find[]

=== Deleting a person : `delete`

Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the database's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
